# Bandifind

A Progressive Web App platform where bands find their musicians and musicians find a new band.

## Description

Bandifind is an app made in a span of 8 weeks. The idea of the app is to match bands with musicians and vice versa. In those 8 weeks we delivered an MVP and a RAT (Riskiest Assumption Test).
